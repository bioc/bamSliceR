               subjects with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) uncovers widespread
               differences in pediatric AML as compared to adult AML, including
               a higher frequency of structural variants and different
               mutational patterns and epigenetic signatures. Future studies
               are needed to characterize the functional relevance of these
               alterations and to explore age-tailored therapies to improve
               disease control in younger patients. We present the molecular
               landscape of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and
               characterize nearly 1,000 participants in Children's Oncology
               Group (COG) AML trials. The COG--National Cancer Institute (NCI)
               TARGET AML initiative assessed cases by whole-genome, targeted
               DNA, mRNA and microRNA sequencing and CpG methylation profiling.
               Validated DNA variants corresponded to diverse, infrequent
               mutations, with fewer than 40 genes mutated in >2\% of cases. In
               contrast, somatic structural variants, including new gene
               fusions and focal deletions of MBNL1, ZEB2 and ELF1, were
               disproportionately prevalent in young individuals as compared to
               adults. Conversely, mutations in DNMT3A and TP53, which were
               common in adults, were conspicuously absent from virtually all
               pediatric cases. New mutations in GATA2, FLT3 and CBL and
               recurrent mutations in MYC-ITD, NRAS, KRAS and WT1 were frequent
               in pediatric AML. Deletions, mutations and promoter DNA

              mutational patterns within and across patients as well as a
              dearth of pharmacologic agents for most mutational events. Here
              we report initial findings from the Beat AML programme on a
              cohort of 672 tumour specimens collected from 562 patients. We
              assessed these specimens using whole-exome sequencing, RNA

              reveal mutational events that have not previously been detected

              mutational status, including instances of drug sensitivity that
              are specific to combinatorial mutational events. Integration with
              RNA sequencing also revealed gene expression signatures, which
              predict a role for specific gene networks in the drug response.

              development and human disease. Recognition of modified histones
              by 'reader' proteins is a key mechanism that mediates the
              function of histone modifications, but how the dysregulation of
              these readers might contribute to disease remains poorly
              understood. We previously identified the ENL protein as a reader
              of histone acetylation via its YEATS domain, linking it to the
              expression of cancer-driving genes in acute leukaemia1. Recurrent
              hotspot mutations have been found in the ENL YEATS domain in
              Wilms tumour2,3, the most common type of paediatric kidney
              cancer. Here we show, using human and mouse cells, that these
              mutations impair cell-fate regulation by conferring
              gain-of-function in chromatin recruitment and transcriptional
              control. ENL mutants induce gene-expression changes that favour a
              premalignant cell fate, and, in an assay for nephrogenesis using
              murine cells, result in undifferentiated structures resembling
              those observed in human Wilms tumour. Mechanistically, although
              bound to largely similar genomic loci as the wild-type protein,
              ENL mutants exhibit increased occupancy at a subset of targets,
              leading to a marked increase in the recruitment and activity of
              transcription elongation machinery that enforces active
              transcription from target loci. Furthermore, ectopically
              expressed ENL mutants exhibit greater self-association and form
              discrete and dynamic nuclear puncta that are characteristic of
              biomolecular hubs consisting of local high concentrations of
              regulatory factors. Such mutation-driven ENL self-association is
              functionally linked to enhanced chromatin occupancy and gene
              activation. Collectively, our findings show that hotspot
              mutations in a chromatin-reader domain drive self-reinforced
              recruitment, derailing normal cell-fate control during
              development and leading to an oncogenic outcome.",

              major leukemic clones in patients. They increase the frequency of
              functional HSCs, alter differentiation, and amplify leukemic
              aggressiveness. These effects are dependent on the specific
              mutation. H3K27 mutation increases the expression of genes
              involved in erythrocyte and myeloid differentiation with altered
              H3K27 tri-methylation and K27 acetylation. The functional impact
              of histone mutations is independent of RUNX1 mutation, although
              they at times co-occur. This study establishes that H3 mutations
              are drivers of human pre-cancerous stem cell expansion and
              important early events in leukemogenesis.",

              pediatric AML that commonly co-occurs with FLT3-ITD mutations and
              is associated with poor outcomes, regardless of FLT3-ITD status.
              With increased recognition of the inferior prognostic impact of
              FLT3-ITD and to a lesser degree t(6;9), and with early
              identification of these lesions, these patients have been
              allocated to high risk intensive therapy on more contemporary
              clinical trials. Therefore we sought to interrogate the outcome
              of children with t(6;9) AML to determine if intensification of
              therapy, specifically the use of hematopoietic stem cell
              transplant (HSCT) in CR1, and FLT3 inhibitors for ITD+ patients,
              may have improved outcomes for this high risk group of patients.
              We evaluated the outcomes of all patients with t(6;9) detected by
              karyotype analysis on pediatric patients with de novo AML
              enrolled on the previous 7 Children's Oncology Group (COG) or its
              predecessor (POG or CCG) trials over 31 years (1988-2017). A
              total of 66 cases of t(6;9) AML were identified from CCG-2861
              (n=2), CCG-2891 (n=5), POG-9421 (n=7), CCG-2961 (n=10), AAML03P1
              (n=7), AAML0531 (n=17), and AAML1031 (n=18). For all studies
              prior to 2005 (CCG-2861, CCG-2891, POG-9421, CCG-2961) neither
              t(6;9) nor FLT3-ITD was used as a prognostic factor to adjust
              treatment, while on AAML0531 post an amendment in 2008 all
              patients on AAML1031 with high allelic ratio (HAR; >0.4) FLT3-ITD
              were allocated to HSCT in CR1, which continued on AAML1031 and
              this group of patients also received sorafenib. Among all 66
              t(6;9) patients identified, 45 (68\%) had known data for ITD.
              Among these, 69\% (n=31) harbored a co-occurring FLT3-ITD
              mutation (AR range 0.07-13.35), while 31\% (n=14) were FLT3-ITD
              negative. In the early phase of trials prior to recognition of
              FLT3-ITD (1988-2002; CCG-2861, CCG-2891, POG-9421, and CCG-2961),
              the 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS)
              for all t(6;9) patients was dismal at 14\% and 18\%, respectively
              (Figure 1). Trials from 2006-2010 (AAML03P1, AAML0531), evaluated
              the addition of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) to chemotherapy as
              well as the use of HSCT in CR1 for patients with matched related
              donors, and the 5-year EFS and OS for patients with t(6;9)
              improved to 48\% and 58\% (p<0.001 compared to 1998-2002, Figure
              1). Among this group of patients, only 16\% received HSCT in CR1.
              The prevalence and clinical implications of FLT3-ITD in childhood
              AML was reported early and was incorporated as a risk stratifying
              biomarker following an amendment to 0531 and for all FLT3-ITD
              patients with HAR disease on AAML1031; this cohort was considered
              high risk and allocated to intensified therapy, which in many
              cases significantly impacted the treatment of patients t(6;9)
              given the significant overlap. In the most recent trial
              (AAML1031, 2011-2017), the 5-yr EFS and OS for patients with
              t(6;9) was excellent at 71\% and 94\%, which was significantly
              improved compared to other trials (p<0.001; Figure 1). Among the
              18 t(6;9) patients on 1031, 72\% (n=13) were allocated to HSCT in
              CR1, the indication for 7 was HAR FLT3-ITD and they also received
              sorafenib and for 6 was presence of residual disease after
              induction 1 (4 with LAR FLT3-ITD, 2 ITD negative). The EFS and OS
              for the t(6;9)/FLT3-ITD HAR and t(6;9)/FLT3-ITD LAR/neg ITD
              groups who both received HSCT in CR1 were comparable and very
              good (EFS: 87.5\% vs 100\%, OS: 87.5\% vs 100\%, p=NS for both).
              We show that over the past 3 decades, outcomes of patients with
              t(6;9) AML have improved significantly on upfront trials. While
              general improvements in AML treatment and supportive care are an
              important aspect, our data with excellent EFS on AAML1031 suggest
              that the intensification of upfront therapy with HSCT, which
              occurred for many t(6;9) patients due to their co-occurrence with
              FLT3-ITD, was critical to these improvements. On the current COG
              phase III AAML1831 trial, all patients with t(6;9) regardless of
              ITD status are considered high risk and allocated to HSCT in CR1,
              while those with a FLT3 mutation also receive gilteritinib.
              Evaluation of the outcome of t(6;9) patients with this therapy
              will be important as while FLT3-ITD patients have been an example
              of a group whose poor outcomes have been shown to be abrogated
              with intensified therapy, it appears that t(6;9) patients may
              have benefitted from their co-occurrence pattern and are also a
              group whose outcomes can be significantly improved with an
              intensified upfront therapeutic approach. Figure 1 Disclosures

              useful for prognosis and for selecting targeted therapies.
              Detection of such mutations using next-generation sequencing data
              requires a computationally intensive read mapping step followed
              by several variant calling methods. Targeted mutation
              identification drastically shifts the usual tradeoff between
              accuracy and performance by concentrating all computations over a
              small portion of sequence space. Here, we present km, an
              efficient approach leveraging k-mer decomposition of reads to
              identify targeted mutations. Our approach is versatile, as it can
              detect single-base mutations, several types of insertions and
              deletions, as well as fusions. We used two independent cohorts
              (The Cancer Genome Atlas and Leucegene) to show that mutation
              detection by km is fast, accurate, and mainly limited by
              sequencing depth. Therefore, km allows the establishment of fast
              diagnostics from next-generation sequencing data and could be
              suitable for clinical applications.",

  abstract = "In the last decades, transcriptome profiling has been one of the
              most utilized approaches to investigate human diseases at the
              molecular level. Through expression studies, many molecular
              biomarkers and therapeutic targets have been found for several
              human pathologies. This number is continuously increasing thanks
              to total RNA sequencing. Indeed, this new technology has
              completely revolutionized transcriptome analysis allowing the
              quantification of gene expression levels and allele-specific
              expression in a single experiment, as well as to identify novel
              genes, splice isoforms, fusion transcripts, and to investigate
              the world of non-coding RNA at an unprecedented level. RNA
              sequencing has also been employed in important projects, like
              ENCODE (Encyclopedia of the regulatory elements) and TCGA (The
              Cancer Genome Atlas), to provide a snapshot of the transcriptome
              of dozens of cell lines and thousands of primary tumor specimens.
              Moreover, these studies have also paved the way to the
              development of data integration approaches in order to facilitate
              management and analysis of data and to identify novel disease
              markers and molecular targets to use in the clinics. In this
              scenario, several ongoing clinical trials utilize transcriptome
              profiling through RNA sequencing strategies as an important

              post-processing alignments in the SAM format, such as indexing,
              variant caller and alignment viewer, and thus provides universal
